    <h1 id="how-to-write-a-resignation-letter">How to write a resignation letter</h1>
<p>Recently, I was asked for advice on how to write a resignation letter. I thought I’d share here in case this information is more widely useful. I’ve provided a template along with the actual letter I used when I left my last job (with some sensitive information redacted).
You’ll notice that some of the text on this page is highlighted in yellow— I’ve used a tool called <a href="https://web.hypothes.is/">Hypothesis</a> to annotate the template and example letters. Click on the yellow text to open the annotation sidebar and read the attached annotations.</p>

<h2 id="template">Template</h2>
<blockquote>
  <p>[DATE OF MEETING WITH MANAGER]</p>

  <p>Dear [MANAGER],</p>

<h2 id="example">Example</h2>
<p>November 21, 2017</p>

<p>Dear [Manager name redacted],</p>

<p>Please accept this letter as formal notification that I am resigning from my position as Educational Technology Specialist at the NYU Faculty of Arts &amp; Science Office of Educational Technology. I have accepted a software engineering position outside of NYU, effective January 1, 2018. My last day at NYU will be December 22, 2017.</p>

<p>As you know, I have been a full-time employee of NYU for over 5 years, having joined the FAS Office of Ed Tech in January 2016. In the nearly two years of working with this department I have developed new design and technical skills, presented at a conference for the first time, and worked with extraordinary educators on course innovations and enhancements.</p>

<p>I’m so grateful for the supportive and encouraging environment you have created in the Office of Ed Tech, and would like you to know that my decision to leave was not an easy one. During my last weeks here, I will of course work with you to ensure my projects are wrapped up or handed off seamlessly, and to transfer ownership of all knowledge, documents, and supplies to you and the rest of the team as appropriate.</p>

<p>I hope to keep in touch and to hear about all the amazing work I know this department will continue to do.</p>

<p>Best wishes,</p>

<p>Katelyn Lemay</p>
